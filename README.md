# Rain_prediction_in_Australia

This project is based on the prediction of rainfall of every City in the Australia Model prediction is created in supervised Classification. There are several operations are held in this project which includes:

Analysing the dataset
Treating the null values by replacing them by using Some imputation techniques
Scaling are done to normalize the data
Later train_test_split are held to start the modeling with test_size of 20%
By intial LogisticRegression are performed and r2_score for both train and test are shown
Future selection are held to get coefficient of variation value
By making various Regularisation like Random forest,Decision Tree,XGBoost to look though the best model
At finally Gradient Descent are performed to get better model
